Abstract
---------------
Industries cooperate with intermediary institutions as third-party businesses when buying and selling energy, which brings along cost escalation and privacy concerns. Internet of Things (IoT), digital transformation and blockchain are the most compelling potential solutions for such problems. In  this  work,  a  platform  where  energy  generating  companies  can  exchange  energy  in  a  more affordable way and in accordance with privacy principles has been designed and implemented. This is achieved, as the energy producers log their transfers to energy consumers using a blockchain. It will be shown that the system works in accordance with privacy principles with theshared blockchain images. Also, it will be illustrated that is more affordable than the system in which third parties are included with cost analysis.
